      <p><strong>Article Content</strong></p>
      <p>The article content can be created using the<strong> Article Editor</strong>, which is a basic HTML editor or Article content can be<strong> imported from a .MHT</strong> file or the Article Content can be directed at an<strong> uploaded attachment.</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Article Editor </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Article content editor provides a rich editor window for entering or pasting the content of the article.</li>
          <li>Hover your mouse over each button icon to see the function of the button.</li>
          <li>See the topic <a href="content_editor.html">Modifying Article Content</a>, for more information about using the Content editor. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Import Content</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Import Content button allows you to upload a .MHT file which will be converted to HTML and stored as the Article content. </li>
          <li>MHT files can be produced from Microsoft Word by saving a document in .MHT/MHTML format and can contain images which are embeded in the file. This provides an easier method than taking an existing word document, extracting the images and uploading each image separately.</li>
          <li>Some formatting problems can occur on complex documents. </li>
          <li>Note: Do not use this feature for large documents (&gt; 100K) as editing dynamic content for large documents within the browser will cause  performance problems with the desktop browser. Instead large documents should be included as an attachment or attachment as content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Attachment as Content</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You may upload a Word, MS Excel, PDF file etc as an attachment that will be used as the article content without conversion. </li>
          <li>In this case the content body of the article is emtpy, and this attachment is viewed automatically embeded in a frame using its native application (Word, Excel, PDF Reader). </li>
          <li>When you upload an Attachment as Content, the Article Editor will disappear and this attachment will override the content.</li>
          <li>To update this content, you will need to press the Replace button and upload a newer version of the document. The previous version will be archived.</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><strong>Article Archives </strong></p>
      <p>When ever a change is made to the content or attachments of an article, the complete article and its attachments are archived. Users with Approval or higher privilage can view the archive versions by using the links when viewing the article. When in the article administraion window you can also restore previous archives as the active version (thus undoing any changes made).</p>
      <p>The default number of versions to keep is 5, but this can be controlled by an Administrator.</p></td>
